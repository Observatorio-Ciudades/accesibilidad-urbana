def is_projected(crs): # various
    """
    Determine if a coordinate reference system is projected or not.
    This is a convenience wrapper around the pyproj.CRS.is_projected function.

    Arguments:
    crs (string or pyproj.CRS): the coordinate reference system

    Returns:
    projected (bool) True if crs is projected, otherwise False

def nearest_nodes(G, nodes, X, Y, return_dist=False): # proximity
    """
    Find the nearest node to a point or to each of several points.
    If `X` and `Y` are single coordinate values, this will return the nearest
    node to that point. If `X` and `Y` are lists of coordinate values, this
    will return the nearest node to each point.
    If the graph is projected, this uses a k-d tree for euclidean nearest
    neighbor search, which requires that scipy is installed as an optional
    dependency. If it is unprojected, this uses a ball tree for haversine
    nearest neighbor search, which requires that scikit-learn is installed as
    an optional dependency.
    Arguments:
        G (networkx.MultiDiGraph) graph in which to find nearest nodes
        X (float or list) points' x (longitude) coordinates, in same CRS/units as graph and containing no nulls
        Y (float or list): Points' y (latitude) coordinates, in same CRS/units as graph and containing no nulls
        return_dist (bool): Optionally also return distance between points and nearest nodes
    Returns:

        between the points and their nearest nodes
